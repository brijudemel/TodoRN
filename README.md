# TodoRN
### Todo app developed with React Native with react-native cli
This To-do app can hold upto 5 different lists of todos. It uses Async Storage to store and retrive data so that data is not refreshed after each render.
I have also worked with Context API of react in this project. Todo can be deleted once done.
